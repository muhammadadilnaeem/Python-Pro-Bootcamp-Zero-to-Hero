    "# ***Understanding `if __name__ == \"__main__\":`***\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **What is `__name__`?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, `__name__` is a built-in variable that represents the name of the current module. It helps identify whether a Python file is being run as the main program or if it is being imported as a module in another program.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If a Python file is run directly, `__name__` is set to `\"__main__\"`.\n",
    "- If the file is imported as a module in another file, `__name__` is set to the name of the module.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Purpose of `if __name__ == \"__main__\":`**\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary purpose of this construct is to allow or prevent parts of code from being executed when the module is imported versus when it is run directly. This is particularly useful for:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Organizing Code**: It helps in organizing code and separating script execution from function definitions.\n",
    "2. **Testing**: You can include test code that will only run when the module is executed directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Syntax**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    # Code to execute if the module is run directly\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "Letâ€™s look at an example to illustrate how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: `my_module.py`**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def greet(name):\n",
    "    return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    # This block will run only if the script is executed directly\n",
    "    print(greet(\"Alice\"))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you run `my_module.py` directly**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ python my_module.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Hello, Alice!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you import `my_module` in another script**:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: `main.py`**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import my_module\n",
    "\n",
    "print(my_module.greet(\"Bob\"))  # Output: Hello, Bob!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Running `main.py`**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ python main.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Hello, Bob!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the `greet` function is available for use, but the print statement within the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block does not execute since `my_module.py` is being imported, not run directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Benefits of Using `if __name__ == \"__main__\":`**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Code Reusability**: Functions and classes can be reused in other scripts without executing the script's main code.\n",
    "2. **Testing**: You can write tests or demo code that runs only when the module is run directly, helping to verify functionality during development.\n",
    "3. **Avoiding Side Effects**: Prevents unintended side effects when modules are imported, keeping the namespace clean.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Common Use Cases**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Script Execution**: When creating scripts that can be executed directly or imported as modules.\n",
    "2. **Testing and Debugging**: Including simple test cases or debugging code that can be executed when developing a module.\n",
    "3. **Command-Line Interfaces**: Setting up scripts that perform different actions based on command-line arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` construct is a fundamental feature in Python that enhances code organization, reusability, and testing. It allows developers to write clean and maintainable code, ensuring that certain parts of the code only run when intended. Understanding and using this construct effectively is essential for Python programming. \n",
