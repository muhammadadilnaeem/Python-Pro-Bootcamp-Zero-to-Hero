    "# ***`What is Inheritance?`***\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inheritance** is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows a class (called a **child class** or **subclass**) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (called a **parent class** or **superclass**). This mechanism promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Purpose of Inheritance**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Code Reusability**: Inheritance enables the reuse of existing code, allowing new classes to use the functionalities of existing ones without rewriting code.\n",
    "2. **Hierarchical Classification**: It helps in creating a structured and logical classification of classes, making it easier to understand and maintain the code.\n",
    "3. **Polymorphism**: Inheritance allows for polymorphism, where a child class can override methods of the parent class to provide specific implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Types of Inheritance**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Single Inheritance**: A child class inherits from a single parent class.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class Parent:\n",
    "       pass\n",
    "\n",
    "   class Child(Parent):\n",
    "       pass\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Multiple Inheritance**: A child class inherits from multiple parent classes.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class Parent1:\n",
    "       pass\n",
    "\n",
    "   class Parent2:\n",
    "       pass\n",
    "\n",
    "   class Child(Parent1, Parent2):\n",
    "       pass\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Multilevel Inheritance**: A child class inherits from a parent class, which in turn inherits from another parent class.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class Grandparent:\n",
    "       pass\n",
    "\n",
    "   class Parent(Grandparent):\n",
    "       pass\n",
    "\n",
    "   class Child(Parent):\n",
    "       pass\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Hierarchical Inheritance**: Multiple child classes inherit from a single parent class.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class Parent:\n",
    "       pass\n",
    "\n",
    "   class Child1(Parent):\n",
    "       pass\n",
    "\n",
    "   class Child2(Parent):\n",
    "       pass\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Hybrid Inheritance**: A combination of two or more types of inheritance, such as multilevel and multiple inheritance.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class Parent:\n",
    "       pass\n",
    "\n",
    "   class Child1(Parent):\n",
    "       pass\n",
    "\n",
    "   class Child2(Parent):\n",
    "       pass\n",
    "\n",
    "   class Grandchild(Child1, Child2):\n",
    "       pass\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Syntax of Inheritance**\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax for creating a child class that inherits from a parent class is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Parent:\n",
    "    # Parent class code\n",
    "\n",
    "class Child(Parent):\n",
    "    # Child class code\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Example of Inheritance**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Basic Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Parent class\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        return \"Animal speaks\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Child class inheriting from Animal\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    def bark(self):\n",
    "        return \"Dog barks\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating an instance of Dog\n",
    "dog = Dog()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Accessing methods from both Dog and Animal\n",
    "print(dog.speak())  # Output: Animal speaks\n",
    "print(dog.bark())   # Output: Dog barks\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Multiple Inheritance Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Canine:\n",
    "    def bark(self):\n",
    "        return \"Bark!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Pet:\n",
    "    def play(self):\n",
    "        return \"Playing!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog(Canine, Pet):\n",
    "    def wag_tail(self):\n",
    "        return \"Wagging tail!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating an instance of Dog\n",
    "dog = Dog()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Accessing methods from Canine and Pet\n",
    "print(dog.bark())    # Output: Bark!\n",
    "print(dog.play())    # Output: Playing!\n",
    "print(dog.wag_tail())  # Output: Wagging tail!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Method Overriding**\n",
    "\n",
    "A child class can override methods of its parent class to provide specific implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        return \"Animal speaks\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Cat(Animal):\n",
    "    def speak(self):  # Method overriding\n",
    "        return \"Cat meows\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating an instance of Cat\n",
    "cat = Cat()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Accessing overridden method\n",
    "print(cat.speak())  # Output: Cat meows\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## **The `super()` Function**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `super()` function allows you to call methods from the parent class. It is useful in cases where you want to extend the functionality of the parent class method in the child class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example of Using `super()`**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        return \"Animal speaks\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Cat(Animal):\n",
    "    def speak(self):  # Method overriding\n",
    "        return super().speak() + \" and Cat meows\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating an instance of Cat\n",
    "cat = Cat()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Accessing overridden method\n",
    "print(cat.speak())  # Output: Animal speaks and Cat meows\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Advantages of Inheritance**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Code Reusability**: Reduces redundancy by allowing classes to share code.\n",
    "2. **Easy Maintenance**: Changes in the parent class automatically propagate to child classes.\n",
    "3. **Logical Structure**: Creates a clear hierarchical structure that reflects real-world relationships.\n",
    "4. **Polymorphism**: Enables different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is a powerful feature in Python that facilitates code reuse, logical organization, and polymorphism. By understanding the different types of inheritance and how to implement them, you can write more efficient and maintainable code.\n",
