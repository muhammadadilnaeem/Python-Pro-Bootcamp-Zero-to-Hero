    "# ***`What is Method Overriding?`***\n",
    "\n",
    "**Method Overriding** in Python occurs when a child class provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class. This allows the child class to modify or extend the behavior of the method inherited from the parent class. Overriding is a key feature of polymorphism in object-oriented programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Characteristics of Method Overriding**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Same Method Name**: The method in the child class must have the same name as the method in the parent class.\n",
    "2. **Same Parameters**: The method signature (parameters) must also match that of the parent class.\n",
    "3. **Dynamic Binding**: The method that gets called is determined at runtime based on the object type, not the reference type.\n",
    "4. **Access to Parent Method**: The child class can still call the parent class’s method using the `super()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Syntax**\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax for method overriding is straightforward:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Parent:\n",
    "    def method_name(self):\n",
    "        # Parent class method implementation\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class Child(Parent):\n",
    "    def method_name(self):\n",
    "        # Child class method implementation (overrides Parent)\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Example of Method Overriding**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Basic Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Parent class\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        return \"Animal speaks\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Child class inheriting from Animal\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    def speak(self):  # Method overriding\n",
    "        return \"Dog barks\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating instances\n",
    "animal = Animal()\n",
    "dog = Dog()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Accessing methods\n",
    "print(animal.speak())  # Output: Animal speaks\n",
    "print(dog.speak())     # Output: Dog barks\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Using `super()` in Overridden Methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the `super()` function to call the parent class’s method within the overridden method in the child class.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        return \"Animal speaks\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Cat(Animal):\n",
    "    def speak(self):  # Method overriding\n",
    "        return super().speak() + \" and Cat meows\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating an instance of Cat\n",
    "cat = Cat()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Accessing the overridden method\n",
    "print(cat.speak())  # Output: Animal speaks and Cat meows\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Overriding with Multiple Levels**\n",
    "\n",
    "Method overriding can occur at multiple levels in an inheritance hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Vehicle:\n",
    "    def start(self):\n",
    "        return \"Vehicle is starting\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Car(Vehicle):\n",
    "    def start(self):  # Method overriding\n",
    "        return \"Car is starting\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class ElectricCar(Car):\n",
    "    def start(self):  # Method overriding again\n",
    "        return \"Electric car is starting silently\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating an instance of ElectricCar\n",
    "electric_car = ElectricCar()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Accessing the overridden methods\n",
    "print(electric_car.start())  # Output: Electric car is starting silently\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Advantages of Method Overriding**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Polymorphism**: Allows different classes to define methods with the same name, enabling flexible and interchangeable use of objects.\n",
    "2. **Extensibility**: Enables extending the functionality of existing methods without modifying the parent class.\n",
    "3. **Code Maintenance**: Simplifies code maintenance by allowing changes to be made in child classes without affecting parent classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Challenges of Method Overriding**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Complexity**: Overriding methods in a deep inheritance hierarchy can lead to confusion about which method is being called.\n",
    "2. **Unexpected Behavior**: If not carefully implemented, method overriding can lead to unexpected behavior, especially when multiple levels of inheritance are involved.\n",
    "3. **Tight Coupling**: Child classes may become tightly coupled to the parent class's implementation, making it harder to change the parent class without affecting child classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "Method overriding is a powerful feature in Python that enhances the flexibility and extensibility of object-oriented programming. By allowing child classes to provide specific implementations of inherited methods, it promotes polymorphism and supports cleaner, more maintainable code. Understanding how to effectively use method overriding is essential for building robust and scalable applications. \n",
