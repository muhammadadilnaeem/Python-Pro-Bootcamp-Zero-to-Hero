    "# ***`What is Multilevel Inheritance?`***\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multilevel Inheritance** is a type of inheritance in which a class (child class) inherits from another class (parent class), which in turn may have its own parent class. This creates a hierarchical relationship among classes, where each child class can inherit attributes and methods from its direct parent class, as well as from its parent's parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Characteristics of Multilevel Inheritance**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Hierarchical Structure**: Multilevel inheritance creates a chain of classes, allowing for a clear hierarchical structure.\n",
    "2. **Code Reusability**: It promotes code reuse by allowing child classes to inherit methods and attributes from multiple levels of parent classes.\n",
    "3. **Method Overriding**: Child classes can override methods inherited from parent classes to provide specific implementations.\n",
    "4. **Ease of Maintenance**: Changes made in a parent class can automatically propagate to child classes, simplifying maintenance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Syntax**\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax for implementing multilevel inheritance is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Grandparent:\n",
    "    # Grandparent class code\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class Parent(Grandparent):\n",
    "    # Parent class code\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class Child(Parent):\n",
    "    # Child class code\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Example of Multilevel Inheritance**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Basic Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Grandparent class\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        return \"Animal speaks\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Parent class inheriting from Animal\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    def bark(self):\n",
    "        return \"Dog barks\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Child class inheriting from Dog\n",
    "class Puppy(Dog):\n",
    "    def whimper(self):\n",
    "        return \"Puppy whimpers\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating an instance of Puppy\n",
    "puppy = Puppy()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Accessing methods from all levels\n",
    "print(puppy.speak())   # Output: Animal speaks\n",
    "print(puppy.bark())    # Output: Dog barks\n",
    "print(puppy.whimper())  # Output: Puppy whimpers\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Method Overriding in Multilevel Inheritance**\n",
    "\n",
    "In multilevel inheritance, a child class can override methods inherited from its parent class or grandparent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        return \"Animal speaks\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    def speak(self):  # Method overriding\n",
    "        return \"Dog barks\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Puppy(Dog):\n",
    "    def whimper(self):\n",
    "        return \"Puppy whimpers\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating an instance of Puppy\n",
    "puppy = Puppy()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Accessing overridden method\n",
    "print(puppy.speak())   # Output: Dog barks\n",
    "print(puppy.whimper())  # Output: Puppy whimpers\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Using `super()` in Multilevel Inheritance**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `super()` function can be used to call methods from parent classes, enabling child classes to extend or modify inherited behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        return \"Animal speaks\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    def speak(self):  # Method overriding\n",
    "        return super().speak() + \" and Dog barks\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Puppy(Dog):\n",
    "    def whimper(self):\n",
    "        return \"Puppy whimpers\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating an instance of Puppy\n",
    "puppy = Puppy()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Accessing the methods\n",
    "print(puppy.speak())   # Output: Animal speaks and Dog barks\n",
    "print(puppy.whimper())  # Output: Puppy whimpers\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Advantages of Multilevel Inheritance**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Code Reusability**: Facilitates reuse of code across multiple levels of the class hierarchy.\n",
    "2. **Logical Structure**: Provides a clear and logical representation of relationships, reflecting real-world hierarchies.\n",
    "3. **Easier Maintenance**: Changes in parent classes can be automatically reflected in child classes, simplifying code maintenance.\n",
    "4. **Polymorphism**: Supports polymorphism by allowing child classes to override methods, thereby providing specific implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Challenges of Multilevel Inheritance**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Complexity**: The class hierarchy can become complex, making it difficult to understand and maintain.\n",
    "2. **Tight Coupling**: Child classes depend heavily on the implementation of parent classes, which can lead to issues if changes are made at higher levels.\n",
    "3. **Method Resolution Order**: Understanding how methods are resolved in a multilevel hierarchy can be challenging, especially when combined with other inheritance types.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "Multilevel inheritance is a powerful feature in Python that allows for the creation of complex class hierarchies while promoting code reuse and logical organization. By understanding how to implement and manage multilevel inheritance, developers can create more efficient and maintainable code.\n",
