    "# ***`What is Single Inheritance?`***\n",
    "\n",
    "**Single Inheritance** is a type of inheritance in which a child class inherits from only one parent class. This creates a straightforward relationship where the child class can access the attributes and methods of the parent class, allowing for code reuse and a clear hierarchical structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Characteristics of Single Inheritance**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Single Parent Class**: In single inheritance, each child class has exactly one parent class.\n",
    "2. **Simple Hierarchy**: The hierarchy is simpler compared to multiple inheritance, making it easier to understand and maintain.\n",
    "3. **Method Overriding**: The child class can override methods of the parent class to provide specific implementations.\n",
    "4. **Code Reusability**: Common functionality can be written in the parent class and reused in the child class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Syntax**\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax for implementing single inheritance is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Parent:\n",
    "    # Parent class code\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class Child(Parent):\n",
    "    # Child class code\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Example of Single Inheritance**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Basic Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Parent class\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        return \"Animal speaks\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Child class inheriting from Animal\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    def bark(self):\n",
    "        return \"Dog barks\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating an instance of Dog\n",
    "dog = Dog()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Accessing methods from both Dog and Animal\n",
    "print(dog.speak())  # Output: Animal speaks\n",
    "print(dog.bark())   # Output: Dog barks\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Method Overriding**\n",
    "\n",
    "In single inheritance, the child class can override methods from the parent class to provide its own implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        return \"Animal speaks\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Cat(Animal):\n",
    "    def speak(self):  # Method overriding\n",
    "        return \"Cat meows\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating an instance of Cat\n",
    "cat = Cat()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Accessing overridden method\n",
    "print(cat.speak())  # Output: Cat meows\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Using `super()` in Single Inheritance**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `super()` function can be used to call methods from the parent class, allowing the child class to extend or modify the parent class's behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        return \"Animal speaks\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Bird(Animal):\n",
    "    def speak(self):  # Method overriding\n",
    "        return super().speak() + \" and Bird chirps\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating an instance of Bird\n",
    "bird = Bird()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Accessing overridden method\n",
    "print(bird.speak())  # Output: Animal speaks and Bird chirps\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Advantages of Single Inheritance**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Simplicity**: The hierarchy is simple and easy to understand, making it straightforward to navigate the code.\n",
    "2. **Reduced Complexity**: Thereâ€™s less ambiguity compared to multiple inheritance, reducing the chances of conflicts in method resolution.\n",
    "3. **Ease of Maintenance**: With a clear inheritance structure, maintaining and updating code becomes easier.\n",
    "4. **Clear Relationships**: Represents a clear \"is-a\" relationship between the parent and child classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "Single inheritance is a fundamental concept in Python that facilitates code reuse and logical organization of classes. By inheriting from a single parent class, child classes can access and override methods, creating a clear and maintainable structure. Understanding single inheritance is essential for effective object-oriented programming in Python.\n",
