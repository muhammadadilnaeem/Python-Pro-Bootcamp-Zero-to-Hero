    "# **`Iterators and Iterables in Python`**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Definitions**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Iterable**: An iterable is an object that can be iterated over (looped through). In Python, all sequences (like lists, tuples, and strings) are iterable objects. You can obtain an iterator from an iterable using the `iter()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Iterator**: An iterator is an object that represents a stream of data. It is an object that implements the iterator protocol, which consists of two methods:\n",
    "  - `__iter__()`: Returns the iterator object itself. This method is required for an object to be considered an iterable.\n",
    "  - `__next__()`: Returns the next value from the iterator. When there are no more values to return, it raises a `StopIteration` exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Characteristics**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Stateful**: An iterator maintains its state between calls, meaning it keeps track of where it is in the iteration process.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Exhaustible**: Once an iterator has been exhausted (i.e., all values have been retrieved), it cannot be reused. You would need to create a new iterator from the iterable.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Memory Efficient**: Iterators do not store their contents in memory; instead, they generate items on-the-fly, making them more memory efficient for large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Creating Iterables and Iterators**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Built-in Iterables**\n",
    "\n",
    "Common built-in iterable types in Python include:\n",
    "- Lists\n",
    "- Tuples\n",
    "- Strings\n",
    "- Dictionaries\n",
    "- Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "for item in my_list:\n",
    "    print(item)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Using `iter()` and `next()`**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can convert an iterable to an iterator using the `iter()` function and retrieve items using the `next()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "iterator = iter(my_list)  # Create an iterator from the list\n",
    "\n",
    "print(next(iterator))  # Output: 1\n",
    "print(next(iterator))  # Output: 2\n",
    "print(next(iterator))  # Output: 3\n",
    "# print(next(iterator))  # Raises StopIteration\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Custom Iterator**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create your own iterator by defining a class that implements the `__iter__()` and `__next__()` methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MyIterator:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, limit):\n",
    "        self.limit = limit\n",
    "        self.current = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __iter__(self):\n",
    "        return self\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __next__(self):\n",
    "        if self.current < self.limit:\n",
    "            self.current += 1\n",
    "            return self.current\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            raise StopIteration\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using the custom iterator\n",
    "my_iter = MyIterator(3)\n",
    "for value in my_iter:\n",
    "    print(value)  # Output: 1, 2, 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Usage in Python**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **For Loops**: Python's `for` loops work with iterators behind the scenes. The loop calls `iter()` on the iterable and repeatedly calls `next()` until a `StopIteration` exception is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **List Comprehensions**: You can use iterables in list comprehensions to create new lists efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   squares = [x ** 2 for x in range(5)]\n",
    "   print(squares)  # Output: [0, 1, 4, 9, 16]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Generator Expressions**: These are a concise way to create iterators using a similar syntax to list comprehensions but without storing all items in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   gen = (x ** 2 for x in range(5))\n",
    "   for value in gen:\n",
    "       print(value)  # Output: 0, 1, 4, 9, 16\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Performance Considerations**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Memory Efficiency**: Iterators are more memory efficient than lists because they yield items one at a time, rather than storing the entire list in memory.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Performance**: Accessing items from an iterator is generally faster than looping through a list, especially for large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding iterators and iterables in Python is crucial for effective data processing and manipulation. They provide a powerful way to handle large collections of data without consuming excessive memory. By implementing custom iterators, you can control how data is accessed and processed, leading to more efficient and readable code. \n",
