    "# ***`Generator Functions in Python`***\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Definition**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **generator function** is a special type of function in Python that returns an iterator object. It allows you to create an iterable sequence of values using the `yield` statement instead of returning a single value. Generators are a convenient way to manage data streams and create iterators without the need to implement the iterator protocol explicitly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Characteristics**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Yield Statement**: Instead of `return`, generator functions use the `yield` statement to produce a value and suspend the function’s state. When the function is called again, it resumes execution right after the last `yield`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Stateful**: Generators maintain their internal state between calls. They remember where they left off when they yield a value, making them suitable for producing a series of values over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Memory Efficient**: Generators are memory efficient because they yield items one at a time and only when required, rather than storing an entire list in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Lazy Evaluation**: Generators compute values on-the-fly as you iterate over them, which can improve performance when dealing with large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Creating a Generator Function**\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a generator function, define a function using the `def` keyword and include one or more `yield` statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Example: Simple Generator Function**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def count_up_to(n):\n",
    "    count = 1\n",
    "    while count <= n:\n",
    "        yield count  # Yield the current count\n",
    "        count += 1   # Increment the count\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using the generator function\n",
    "for number in count_up_to(5):\n",
    "    print(number)  # Output: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How It Works**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Function Call**: When `count_up_to(5)` is called, it returns a generator object but does not start execution immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Iteration**: When you iterate over the generator (using a `for` loop or `next()`), the function executes until it hits the first `yield` statement, returning the value of `count`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **State Preservation**: The function's state is preserved. When the next value is requested, execution resumes right after the last `yield`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Termination**: When the loop completes and there are no more values to yield, the function raises a `StopIteration` exception, signaling the end of the iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Advantages of Generator Functions**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Simplicity**: Generators simplify the process of creating iterators, as you do not need to implement `__iter__()` and `__next__()` methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Performance**: Generators can be more efficient than list comprehensions for large datasets, as they produce items one at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Infinite Sequences**: Generators can represent infinite sequences, as they can yield values indefinitely without consuming memory for all possible values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example: Infinite Generator**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how to create a generator that produces an infinite sequence of Fibonacci numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def infinite_fibonacci():\n",
    "    a, b = 0, 1\n",
    "    while True:  # Infinite loop\n",
    "        yield a  # Yield the current Fibonacci number\n",
    "        a, b = b, a + b  # Update values\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using the infinite Fibonacci generator\n",
    "fib_gen = infinite_fibonacci()\n",
    "for _ in range(10):  # Print the first 10 Fibonacci numbers\n",
    "    print(next(fib_gen))  # Output: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Generator Expressions**\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to generator functions, Python also provides a concise way to create generators using **generator expressions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Syntax**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "(expression for item in iterable if condition)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Example: Generator Expression**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "squares = (x ** 2 for x in range(10))  # Generator expression for squares\n",
    "\n",
    "for square in squares:\n",
    "    print(square)  # Output: 0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "Generator functions and expressions are powerful tools in Python for creating iterators. They provide a simple and efficient way to generate values on-the-fly without the overhead of storing entire datasets in memory. By using `yield`, you can create custom iterables that are both flexible and easy to manage. \n",
