    "# **`LEGB Rule in Python`**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Definition**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **LEGB Rule** defines the order in which Python resolves variable names. It stands for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **L**ocal\n",
    "- **E**nclosing\n",
    "- **G**lobal\n",
    "- **B**uilt-in\n",
    "\n",
    "When a variable is referenced, Python searches for it in these scopes in the specified order until it finds the variable or raises a `NameError` if the variable is not found.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Scope Levels**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Local Scope (L)**\n",
    "   - This is the innermost scope, which includes variables defined within the current function. \n",
    "   - These variables are accessible only within that function and are created when the function is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def my_function():\n",
    "       local_var = \"I am local\"\n",
    "       print(local_var)  # Accessible here\n",
    "\n",
    "   my_function()\n",
    "   # print(local_var)  # Raises NameError: name 'local_var' is not defined\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Enclosing Scope (E)**\n",
    "   - This scope refers to the variables in the nearest enclosing function. It applies when you have nested functions.\n",
    "   - The inner function can access variables of the outer function.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def outer_function():\n",
    "       enclosing_var = \"I am from outer\"\n",
    "\n",
    "       def inner_function():\n",
    "           print(enclosing_var)  # Accessing variable from the enclosing scope\n",
    "\n",
    "       inner_function()\n",
    "\n",
    "   outer_function()  # Output: I am from outer\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Global Scope (G)**\n",
    "   - Variables defined at the top level of a module or script fall into the global scope. These variables can be accessed from any function within the same module.\n",
    "   - Global variables exist for the duration of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   global_var = \"I am global\"\n",
    "\n",
    "   def my_function():\n",
    "       print(global_var)  # Accessing global variable\n",
    "\n",
    "   my_function()  # Output: I am global\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Built-in Scope (B)**\n",
    "   - This is the outermost scope, which contains names that are built into Python. These include functions like `print()`, `len()`, and exceptions such as `ValueError`.\n",
    "   - Built-in names are available throughout the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   print(len(\"Hello\"))  # Output: 5\n",
    "   # 'len' is a built-in function accessible anywhere\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example of LEGB Rule in Action**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example that illustrates how the LEGB rule works when a variable is referenced:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = \"Global x\"  # Global variable\n",
    "\n",
    "def outer():\n",
    "    x = \"Outer x\"  # Enclosing variable\n",
    "\n",
    "    def inner():\n",
    "        x = \"Inner x\"  # Local variable\n",
    "        print(x)  # This will refer to the local variable\n",
    "\n",
    "    inner()\n",
    "    print(x)  # This will refer to the enclosing variable\n",
    "\n",
    "outer()\n",
    "print(x)  # This will refer to the global variable\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output**:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Inner x\n",
    "Outer x\n",
    "Global x\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Summary of the LEGB Rule**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Local**: Check for the variable in the local scope first (inside the current function).\n",
    "2. **Enclosing**: If not found, check the enclosing function's scope (for nested functions).\n",
    "3. **Global**: If still not found, check the global scope (variables defined at the module level).\n",
    "4. **Built-in**: Finally, check the built-in scope (predefined names in Python).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the LEGB rule is crucial for managing variable scope in Python effectively. By knowing the order of scope resolution, developers can avoid naming conflicts, understand variable lifetimes, and write clearer code.\n",
