    "# ***`Print vs Logging in Python`***\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Definition**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Print Statements**: The `print()` function is used to output information directly to the console. It is often used for debugging or displaying results during program execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Logging**: The `logging` module in Python provides a flexible framework for emitting log messages from Python programs. It allows you to track events that happen during execution, which is especially useful for debugging and monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Use Cases**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Print Statements**:\n",
    "  - Quick debugging during development.\n",
    "  - Simple output of results or status messages.\n",
    "  - Informal logging when the application is small or for simple scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Logging**:\n",
    "  - Tracking application behavior over time.\n",
    "  - Monitoring for errors, warnings, and informational messages in production.\n",
    "  - Recording detailed information for troubleshooting and diagnostics.\n",
    "  - Managing log levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) to control what information is displayed or stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Advantages and Disadvantages**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature            | Print Statements                                 | Logging                                   |\n",
    "|--------------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| **Ease of Use**    | Very simple and straightforward to implement. | Requires setup but provides more control. |\n",
    "| **Flexibility**     | Limited flexibility; output goes to standard output. | Highly configurable; can log to files, streams, etc. |\n",
    "| **Control**        | No control over log levels or output format.  | Can set log levels, format messages, and handle multiple outputs. |\n",
    "| **Performance**    | May slow down the application if used excessively. | Can be configured to minimize performance impact. |\n",
    "| **Persistence**    | Output disappears when the program ends.      | Logs can be saved to files for persistent storage. |\n",
    "| **Error Handling** | Difficult to manage in larger applications.    | Provides structured error handling and reporting. |\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4. Basic Examples**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Using Print Statements**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def divide(x, y):\n",
    "    print(f\"Dividing {x} by {y}\")\n",
    "    return x / y\n",
    "\n",
    "result = divide(10, 2)\n",
    "print(f\"Result: {result}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Using Logging**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import logging\n",
    "\n",
    "# Configure the logging system\n",
    "logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG, format='%(levelname)s: %(message)s')\n",
    "\n",
    "def divide(x, y):\n",
    "    logging.debug(f\"Dividing {x} by {y}\")\n",
    "    return x / y\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    result = divide(10, 0)\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    logging.error(\"Attempted to divide by zero.\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    logging.info(f\"Result: {result}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **5. Log Levels**\n",
    "\n",
    "The logging module supports different log levels to categorize messages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **DEBUG**: Detailed information, typically of interest only when diagnosing problems.\n",
    "- **INFO**: Confirmation that things are working as expected.\n",
    "- **WARNING**: An indication that something unexpected happened or indicative of some problem in the near future (e.g., ‘disk space low’).\n",
    "- **ERROR**: Due to a more serious problem, the software has not been able to perform a function.\n",
    "- **CRITICAL**: A very serious error, indicating that the program itself may be unable to continue running.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **6. Advanced Logging Features**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Loggers**: You can create multiple loggers for different parts of an application, allowing for fine-grained control over logging behavior.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Handlers**: Logging can be directed to different outputs (e.g., console, files, remote servers) using handlers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Formatters**: Custom formats can be specified for log messages, allowing you to include timestamps, log levels, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Filters**: You can filter log messages to control which messages get logged based on certain criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example of Advanced Logging**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import logging\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a custom logger\n",
    "logger = logging.getLogger(\"my_logger\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create handlers\n",
    "console_handler = logging.StreamHandler()\n",
    "file_handler = logging.FileHandler(\"app.log\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Set levels\n",
    "console_handler.setLevel(logging.WARNING)\n",
    "file_handler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create formatters and add them to handlers\n",
    "formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\n",
    "console_handler.setFormatter(formatter)\n",
    "file_handler.setFormatter(formatter)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add handlers to the logger\n",
    "logger.addHandler(console_handler)\n",
    "logger.addHandler(file_handler)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Logging messages\n",
    "logger.debug(\"This is a debug message.\")\n",
    "logger.info(\"This is an info message.\")\n",
    "logger.warning(\"This is a warning message.\")\n",
    "logger.error(\"This is an error message.\")\n",
    "logger.critical(\"This is a critical message.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "While `print()` is simple and effective for quick debugging, the `logging` module provides a robust framework for tracking events, diagnosing issues, and managing application behavior in both development and production environments. For larger or more complex applications, logging is generally the better choice due to its flexibility and configurability.\n",
