    "# ***`Logging with Exception Handling in Python`***\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Importance**\n",
    "\n",
    "Logging exceptions is crucial for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Debugging**: Capturing the details of exceptions helps identify the root cause of issues in the code.\n",
    "- **Monitoring**: It provides insights into application behavior and helps track down errors that occur in production.\n",
    "- **Auditing**: Logs can serve as a historical record of errors and exceptions that occurred during the application runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Setting Up Logging**\n",
    "\n",
    "Before logging exceptions, it's essential to set up the logging configuration. This can be done using `basicConfig()` or a more advanced configuration as previously discussed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Basic Logging Configuration**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import logging\n",
    "\n",
    "# Basic configuration for logging\n",
    "logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Logging Exceptions**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can log exceptions using the `logging` module's methods. The `exception()` method is particularly useful because it automatically captures the stack trace of the current exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example of Logging Exceptions**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a practical example demonstrating how to log exceptions during exception handling:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import logging\n",
    "\n",
    "# Configure logging\n",
    "logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\n",
    "\n",
    "def divide(x, y):\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        result = x / y\n",
    "        return result\n",
    "    except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n",
    "        logging.exception(\"Exception occurred while dividing %s by %s\", x, y)\n",
    "        return None\n",
    "\n",
    "# Usage\n",
    "result = divide(10, 0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Explanation of the Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Logging Configuration**: The logging is set to DEBUG level, which captures all levels of log messages.\n",
    "2. **Function Definition**: The `divide()` function attempts to divide two numbers.\n",
    "3. **Exception Handling**: If a `ZeroDivisionError` occurs, the `exception()` method logs the error along with the stack trace.\n",
    "4. **Logging Message**: The message includes details about the operation that failed, enhancing the context for debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Additional Exception Logging Techniques**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Using `error()` Method**: You can also use the `error()` method if you don’t need the stack trace.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       result = divide(10, 0)\n",
    "   except Exception as e:\n",
    "       logging.error(\"An error occurred: %s\", e)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Custom Exception Classes**: You can create custom exceptions and log them in a similar manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class CustomError(Exception):\n",
    "       pass\n",
    "\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       raise CustomError(\"This is a custom error.\")\n",
    "   except CustomError as e:\n",
    "       logging.exception(\"Caught a custom exception: %s\", e)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Best Practices for Logging Exceptions**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Log at the Appropriate Level**: Use `logging.error()` or `logging.critical()` for serious issues, and `logging.warning()` for potential issues that don’t stop execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Include Contextual Information**: Always include relevant contextual information in your log messages, such as function arguments or user identifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Use `exception()` for Tracebacks**: Use `logging.exception()` to automatically include the stack trace of the exception, which is invaluable for debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Be Cautious with Sensitive Data**: Avoid logging sensitive information (like passwords or personal data) to protect user privacy and comply with data protection regulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Review Log Files Regularly**: Regularly check log files to identify trends, recurring issues, or unexpected behavior in your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Implement Centralized Logging**: For larger applications, consider implementing centralized logging solutions (like ELK stack, Splunk, or cloud-based logging services) for better monitoring and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "Logging with exception handling is a vital part of robust application development in Python. By effectively capturing and logging exceptions, you can improve your ability to diagnose issues, monitor application health, and maintain high-quality software. \n",
