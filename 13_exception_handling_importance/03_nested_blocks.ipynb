    "# ***`Nested Blocks in Python`***\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Definition**\n",
    "\n",
    "Nested blocks in Python refer to the placement of one block of code (like a function, loop, or conditional statement) inside another block. This allows for more complex control flows and helps in organizing code logically.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Types of Nested Blocks**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Nested Conditional Statements**\n",
    "2. **Nested Loops**\n",
    "3. **Nested Functions**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Nested Conditional Statements**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Description**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can place conditional statements inside other conditional statements. This is useful for checking multiple conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "age = 20\n",
    "is_student = True\n",
    "\n",
    "if age >= 18:\n",
    "    print(\"Adult\")\n",
    "    if is_student:\n",
    "        print(\"You are a student.\")\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print(\"You are not a student.\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Minor\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Flow**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The outer `if` checks if `age` is 18 or older.\n",
    "- If true, it proceeds to the inner `if` to check if the person is a student.\n",
    "- The inner `else` executes if the person is not a student.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Nested Loops**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Description**\n",
    "\n",
    "Loops can be nested within other loops. This is often used for iterating over multi-dimensional data structures, like lists of lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(3):\n",
    "    for j in range(2):\n",
    "        print(f\"i = {i}, j = {j}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Flow**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The outer loop iterates over `i` from 0 to 2.\n",
    "- For each value of `i`, the inner loop iterates over `j` from 0 to 1.\n",
    "- This results in printing pairs of `i` and `j`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Nested Functions**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Description**\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions can be defined inside other functions. This is useful for encapsulation and organizing code logically.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def outer_function(x):\n",
    "    def inner_function(y):\n",
    "        return y + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "    return inner_function(x) * 2\n",
    "\n",
    "result = outer_function(5)\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: 12\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Flow**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `outer_function` is called with an argument of 5.\n",
    "- Inside it, `inner_function` is defined and called with the same argument.\n",
    "- The result of `inner_function` is doubled before being returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Scope of Variables in Nested Blocks**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Local Scope**: Variables defined within a nested block are local to that block. They cannot be accessed from the outer block.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  def outer_function():\n",
    "      x = 10  # Outer variable\n",
    "      def inner_function():\n",
    "          y = 5  # Inner variable\n",
    "          print(x)  # Accesses outer variable\n",
    "      inner_function()\n",
    "      # print(y)  # This would raise a NameError\n",
    "\n",
    "  outer_function()\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Nonlocal Keyword**: In nested functions, if you want to modify a variable from an outer (but not global) scope, you can use the `nonlocal` keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  def outer_function():\n",
    "      x = 10  # Outer variable\n",
    "      def inner_function():\n",
    "          nonlocal x  # Refers to x in outer_function\n",
    "          x += 1\n",
    "          print(x)\n",
    "      inner_function()  # Prints 11\n",
    "      print(x)  # Prints 11\n",
    "\n",
    "  outer_function()\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Best Practices for Using Nested Blocks**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Readability**: Deeply nested blocks can make code harder to read. Aim for clarity and simplicity.\n",
    "2. **Limit Nesting**: Try to limit the levels of nesting. If you find yourself nesting too deeply, consider refactoring your code.\n",
    "3. **Use Functions**: Break down complex nested blocks into separate functions to improve maintainability.\n",
    "4. **Commenting**: Use comments to explain the logic behind nested blocks, especially if they are complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "Nested blocks in Python allow for more complex and organized code structures. By using nested conditionals, loops, and functions effectively, you can create powerful and readable programs. However, itâ€™s essential to manage nesting levels to maintain code readability and prevent confusion. \n",
