    "# ***`Flow of Block Execution in Python`***\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Sequential Execution**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: Python executes code line by line in the order it appears, unless directed otherwise by control structures.\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  print(\"Start\")\n",
    "  print(\"Middle\")\n",
    "  print(\"End\")\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Flow**: \n",
    "  - First prints \"Start\".\n",
    "  - Then prints \"Middle\".\n",
    "  - Finally prints \"End\".\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Conditional Statements**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) allow execution of certain blocks of code based on specific conditions.\n",
    "- **Flow**:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  x = 10\n",
    "\n",
    "  if x > 5:\n",
    "      print(\"x is greater than 5\")\n",
    "  elif x == 5:\n",
    "      print(\"x is equal to 5\")\n",
    "  else:\n",
    "      print(\"x is less than 5\")\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Flow**:\n",
    "  - Checks the condition in the `if` statement.\n",
    "  - Executes the block under `if` if the condition is true.\n",
    "  - If false, checks the `elif` condition.\n",
    "  - Executes the `elif` block if true; otherwise, executes the `else` block.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Loops**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: Loops (`for` and `while`) allow repeated execution of a block of code.\n",
    "- **Flow**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  **For Loop Example**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  for i in range(3):\n",
    "      print(i)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Flow**:\n",
    "  - Initializes `i` to 0.\n",
    "  - Executes the print statement.\n",
    "  - Increments `i` and checks the condition.\n",
    "  - Repeats until the loop condition is false.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **While Loop Example**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  count = 0\n",
    "  while count < 3:\n",
    "      print(count)\n",
    "      count += 1\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Flow**:\n",
    "  - Checks the condition `count < 3`.\n",
    "  - Executes the print statement and increments `count`.\n",
    "  - Repeats until the condition is false.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Function Calls**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: Functions allow encapsulation of code blocks that can be executed when called.\n",
    "- **Flow**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  def greet(name):\n",
    "      print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "  greet(\"Alice\")\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Flow**:\n",
    "  - The program encounters the `greet` function definition but does not execute it.\n",
    "  - When `greet(\"Alice\")` is called, execution jumps to the function's body.\n",
    "  - After executing the function, control returns to the point following the function call.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **Exception Handling**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: Exception handling (`try`, `except`, `else`, `finally`) manages errors that occur during execution.\n",
    "- **Flow**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  try:\n",
    "      result = 10 / 0\n",
    "  except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "      print(\"Cannot divide by zero.\")\n",
    "  else:\n",
    "      print(\"Division successful.\")\n",
    "  finally:\n",
    "      print(\"Execution finished.\")\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Flow**:\n",
    "  - The code in the `try` block is executed.\n",
    "  - If an exception occurs, the flow moves to the `except` block.\n",
    "  - If no exception occurs, the `else` block executes.\n",
    "  - The `finally` block executes regardless of whether an exception was raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. **Control Flow Statements**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Break and Continue**:\n",
    "  - `break` exits a loop immediately.\n",
    "  - `continue` skips the current iteration and proceeds to the next one.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  for i in range(5):\n",
    "      if i == 2:\n",
    "          continue  # Skips printing 2\n",
    "      print(i)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Flow**:\n",
    "  - Prints 0, 1, 3, 4 (skips 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Summary of Block Execution Flow**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sequential Execution**: Code runs line by line.\n",
    "- **Conditionals**: Code blocks execute based on boolean conditions.\n",
    "- **Loops**: Code blocks repeat until a condition is false.\n",
    "- **Functions**: Code executes when called, returning control after completion.\n",
    "- **Exception Handling**: Manages errors and allows cleanup.\n",
    "- **Control Statements**: Modify the flow within loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the flow of block execution in Python is essential for writing effective and efficient code. By mastering conditionals, loops, functions, and exception handling, you can control how your program operates under various conditions, leading to more robust and maintainable applications. \n",
