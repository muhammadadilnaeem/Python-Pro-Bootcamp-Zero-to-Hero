    "# ***`Introduction to OOP in Python`***\n",
    "\n",
    "**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** is a programming paradigm that uses \"objects\" to represent data and methods to operate on that data. Python is a multi-paradigm programming language that supports OOP, allowing developers to create classes and objects, encapsulate data, and implement inheritance and polymorphism.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Concepts of OOP**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`Class`**: A blueprint for creating objects. A class defines properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that the objects created from the class will have.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`Object`**: An instance of a class. An object contains actual data and can perform actions defined by its class methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`Encapsulation`**: The bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit (class). It restricts direct access to some of the object’s components, which is a means of preventing unintended interference.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **`Inheritance`**: A mechanism where a new class (child or derived class) can inherit attributes and methods from an existing class (parent or base class). This promotes code reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **`Polymorphism`**: The ability to use a common interface for different data types. In Python, polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object calling them, enabling the same method name to be used in different classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **`Abstraction`**: The concept of hiding complex implementation details while exposing only the necessary parts of an object. This is often achieved through abstract classes and interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Creating a Class in Python**\n",
    "\n",
    "To define a class, you use the `class` keyword. Here’s a simple example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Dog:\n",
    "    # Constructor to initialize attributes\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.name = name  # Attribute\n",
    "        self.age = age    # Attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Method to describe the dog\n",
    "    def bark(self):\n",
    "        return f\"{self.name} says Woof!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating an object (instance) of the Dog class\n",
    "my_dog = Dog(\"Buddy\", 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Accessing attributes and methods\n",
    "print(my_dog.name)  # Output: Buddy\n",
    "print(my_dog.bark())  # Output: Buddy says Woof!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Encapsulation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation restricts access to certain details of an object. In Python, you can indicate private attributes by prefixing them with an underscore (`_`) or double underscore (`__`).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class BankAccount:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, balance):\n",
    "        self.__balance = balance  # Private attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "    def deposit(self, amount):\n",
    "        self.__balance += amount\n",
    "\n",
    "    def get_balance(self):\n",
    "        return self.__balance\n",
    "\n",
    "account = BankAccount(100)\n",
    "account.deposit(50)\n",
    "print(account.get_balance())  # Output: 150\n",
    "# print(account.__balance)  # Raises AttributeError\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Inheritance**\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance allows one class to inherit the properties and methods of another class.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Base class\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        return \"Animal speaks\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Derived class\n",
    "class Cat(Animal):\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        return \"Meow\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating an object of the derived class\n",
    "my_cat = Cat()\n",
    "print(my_cat.speak())  # Output: Meow\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Polymorphism**\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism allows methods to be used interchangeably, enhancing flexibility in code.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Bird:\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        return \"Chirp\"\n",
    "\n",
    "def make_it_speak(animal):\n",
    "    print(animal.speak())\n",
    "\n",
    "# Instances of different classes\n",
    "my_dog = Dog(\"Buddy\", 3)\n",
    "my_cat = Cat()\n",
    "my_bird = Bird()\n",
    "\n",
    "make_it_speak(my_dog)  # Output: Buddy says Woof!\n",
    "make_it_speak(my_cat)  # Output: Meow\n",
    "make_it_speak(my_bird)  # Output: Chirp\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Abstraction**\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction is often implemented using abstract classes, which cannot be instantiated and must be subclassed.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
    "\n",
    "class Shape(ABC):\n",
    "    @abstractmethod\n",
    "    def area(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class Rectangle(Shape):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, width, height):\n",
    "        self.width = width\n",
    "        self.height = height\n",
    "\n",
    "    def area(self):\n",
    "        return self.width * self.height\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating an object of Rectangle\n",
    "rect = Rectangle(5, 10)\n",
    "print(rect.area())  # Output: 50\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming is a powerful paradigm in Python that promotes code organization, reusability, and maintainability. By utilizing classes, objects, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction, developers can create complex and efficient software solutions. Understanding these concepts is essential for effective Python programming. \n",
