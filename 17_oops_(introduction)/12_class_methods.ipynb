    "# ***`What are Class Methods?`***\n",
    "\n",
    "**Class methods** are methods that are bound to the class and not the instance of the class. They can modify class state that applies across all instances, rather than instance-specific data. Class methods are defined using the `@classmethod` decorator.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Characteristics of Class Methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **First Parameter is `cls`**: The first parameter of a class method is always `cls`, which refers to the class itself. This allows access to class variables and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Shared Across Instances**: Class methods can modify class attributes, and changes will affect all instances of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Can Be Called on the Class or Instance**: Class methods can be called on the class itself or on instances of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Useful for Factory Methods**: Class methods are often used as factory methods that create instances of the class using different sets of parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Syntax**\n",
    "\n",
    "The general syntax for defining a class method is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class ClassName:\n",
    "    @classmethod\n",
    "    def method_name(cls, parameters):\n",
    "        # Method body\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example of Class Methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Defining a `Book` Class with Class Methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Book:\n",
    "    book_count = 0  # Class attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __init__(self, title, author):\n",
    "        self.title = title\n",
    "        self.author = author\n",
    "        Book.book_count += 1  # Increment the book count when a new book is created\n",
    "\n",
    "    @classmethod\n",
    "    def get_book_count(cls):\n",
    "        return cls.book_count  # Accessing class attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "    @classmethod\n",
    "    def create_book(cls, title, author):\n",
    "        return cls(title, author)  # Factory method for creating a Book instance\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating instances of Book\n",
    "book1 = Book(\"1984\", \"George Orwell\")\n",
    "book2 = Book(\"Animal Farm\", \"George Orwell\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calling class method to get book count\n",
    "print(Book.get_book_count())  # Output: 2\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using class method as a factory method\n",
    "book3 = Book.create_book(\"Brave New World\", \"Aldous Huxley\")\n",
    "print(book3.title)  # Output: Brave New World\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Importance of Class Methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Access to Class State**: Class methods allow you to access and modify class-level attributes, making them useful for maintaining shared state.\n",
    "- **Factory Methods**: They can be used to create new instances of the class in a controlled manner or using different parameters.\n",
    "- **Alternative Constructors**: Class methods can serve as alternative constructors to instantiate objects under different conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Calling Class Methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "Class methods can be called using the class name or via an instance of the class. However, they always receive the class as the first argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example of Calling Class Methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Counter:\n",
    "    count = 0  # Class attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "    @classmethod\n",
    "    def increment(cls):\n",
    "        cls.count += 1\n",
    "\n",
    "    @classmethod\n",
    "    def get_count(cls):\n",
    "        return cls.count\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calling class methods directly on the class\n",
    "Counter.increment()\n",
    "print(Counter.get_count())  # Output: 1\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating an instance and calling class methods\n",
    "counter_instance = Counter()\n",
    "counter_instance.increment()\n",
    "print(counter_instance.get_count())  # Output: 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Differences Between Instance Methods and Class Methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature                     | Instance Methods                     | Class Methods                        |\n",
    "|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n",
    "| **First Parameter**         | `self` (instance reference)          | `cls` (class reference)              |\n",
    "| **Access**                  | Access instance attributes            | Access class attributes               |\n",
    "| **Invocation**              | Called on instances                   | Called on the class or instance      |\n",
    "| **State Management**        | Operate on instance-specific data     | Operate on class-level data          |\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "Class methods provide a powerful way to define behaviors that are relevant to the class as a whole rather than to individual instances. They facilitate shared state management and can serve as alternative constructors for creating instances. Understanding class methods is essential for effective Object-Oriented Programming in Python.\n",
