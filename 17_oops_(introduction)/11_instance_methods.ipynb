    "# ***`What are Instance Methods?`***\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instance methods** are functions defined within a class that operate on instances of that class. They are the most common type of method in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python and can access and modify the instance's attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Characteristics of Instance Methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **First Parameter is `self`**: The first parameter of an instance method is always `self`, which refers to the instance of the class. This allows the method to access the instance's attributes and other methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Access to Instance Attributes**: Instance methods can read and modify instance attributes, allowing for dynamic behavior based on the specific instance's state.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Can Call Other Methods**: Instance methods can call other instance methods within the same class using `self`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Can Have Parameters**: Instance methods can take additional parameters (besides `self`) to perform operations based on input.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Syntax**\n",
    "\n",
    "The general syntax for defining an instance method is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class ClassName:\n",
    "    def instance_method(self, parameters):\n",
    "        # Method body\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example of Instance Method**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Defining a `Book` Class with Instance Methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Book:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, title, author):\n",
    "        self.title = title  # Instance attribute\n",
    "        self.author = author  # Instance attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "    def get_info(self):\n",
    "        return f\"'{self.title}' by {self.author}\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    def set_title(self, new_title):\n",
    "        self.title = new_title  # Modifying instance attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating an instance of Book\n",
    "book1 = Book(\"1984\", \"George Orwell\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calling instance methods\n",
    "print(book1.get_info())  # Output: '1984' by George Orwell\n",
    "\n",
    "# Modifying instance attribute using an instance method\n",
    "book1.set_title(\"Animal Farm\")\n",
    "print(book1.get_info())  # Output: 'Animal Farm' by George Orwell\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Importance of Instance Methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Encapsulation**: Instance methods encapsulate behavior specific to the instance, promoting the principles of OOP.\n",
    "- **Reusability**: They allow for code reuse, making it easier to maintain and extend functionality.\n",
    "- **State Management**: They help manage and manipulate the state of the instance over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Calling Instance Methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "Instance methods are called on an instance of the class, and Python automatically passes the instance as the first argument (`self`).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example of Calling Instance Methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Counter:\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self.count = 0  # Instance attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "    def increment(self):\n",
    "        self.count += 1\n",
    "\n",
    "    def get_count(self):\n",
    "        return self.count\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating an instance of Counter\n",
    "counter = Counter()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calling instance methods\n",
    "counter.increment()\n",
    "print(counter.get_count())  # Output: 1\n",
    "\n",
    "counter.increment()\n",
    "print(counter.get_count())  # Output: 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Instance Methods with Parameters**\n",
    "\n",
    "Instance methods can also take additional parameters to perform specific operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example: Instance Method with Parameters**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Rectangle:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, width, height):\n",
    "        self.width = width\n",
    "        self.height = height\n",
    "\n",
    "    def area(self):\n",
    "        return self.width * self.height\n",
    "\n",
    "    def resize(self, new_width, new_height):\n",
    "        self.width = new_width\n",
    "        self.height = new_height\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating an instance of Rectangle\n",
    "rect = Rectangle(4, 5)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calling instance methods\n",
    "print(rect.area())  # Output: 20\n",
    "\n",
    "# Resizing the rectangle\n",
    "rect.resize(6, 8)\n",
    "print(rect.area())  # Output: 48\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "Instance methods are a fundamental aspect of classes in Python, allowing for encapsulation and manipulation of instance data. They provide a way to define behaviors associated with specific objects, facilitating Object-Oriented Programming principles. Understanding how to define and use instance methods is essential for effective Python programming. \n",
