    "# ***`Instance & Methods In Class in Python`***\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What is an Instance?**\n",
    "\n",
    "An **instance** is a specific object created from a class. When you define a class, you are creating a blueprint, and when you create an object from that class, you are creating an instance of that class. Each instance can have its own attributes and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Creating an Instance**\n",
    "\n",
    "To create an instance of a class, you call the class as if it were a function, passing any necessary arguments to the constructor (`__init__` method).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Syntax**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "instance_name = ClassName(arguments)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example of Creating an Instance**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Dog:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating instances of the Dog class\n",
    "dog1 = Dog(\"Buddy\", 3)\n",
    "dog2 = Dog(\"Max\", 5)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(dog1.name)  # Output: Buddy\n",
    "print(dog2.age)   # Output: 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Methods in Python**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What is a Method?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **method** is a function defined inside a class that operates on instances of that class. Methods can manipulate data (attributes) and perform actions related to an instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Types of Methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Instance Methods**: The most common type of method, which takes `self` as its first parameter and can access instance attributes and other methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Class Methods**: Defined with the `@classmethod` decorator, these methods take the class itself as the first parameter (usually named `cls`). They can access class variables and methods but not instance variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Static Methods**: Defined with the `@staticmethod` decorator, these methods do not take `self` or `cls` as a parameter. They behave like regular functions but belong to the class's namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Instance Methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Definition**\n",
    "\n",
    "Instance methods can access and modify instance-specific data. They are defined normally with a `self` parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example of Instance Method**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Circle:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, radius):\n",
    "        self.radius = radius\n",
    "\n",
    "    def area(self):\n",
    "        return 3.14 * (self.radius ** 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating an instance of Circle\n",
    "circle = Circle(5)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calling the instance method\n",
    "print(circle.area())  # Output: 78.5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Class Methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Definition**\n",
    "\n",
    "Class methods can be called on the class itself and can access class variables. They cannot modify instance-specific data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Syntax**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class ClassName:\n",
    "    @classmethod\n",
    "    def method_name(cls, parameters):\n",
    "        # Method body\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example of Class Method**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Dog:\n",
    "    species = \"Canis familiaris\"  # Class variable\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "\n",
    "    @classmethod\n",
    "    def get_species(cls):\n",
    "        return cls.species\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calling the class method\n",
    "print(Dog.get_species())  # Output: Canis familiaris\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Static Methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Definition**\n",
    "\n",
    "Static methods are similar to class methods but do not require any reference to the instance or the class. They are defined using the `@staticmethod` decorator.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Syntax**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class ClassName:\n",
    "    @staticmethod\n",
    "    def method_name(parameters):\n",
    "        # Method body\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example of Static Method**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MathUtils:\n",
    "    @staticmethod\n",
    "    def add(x, y):\n",
    "        return x + y\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calling the static method\n",
    "print(MathUtils.add(5, 3))  # Output: 8\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Summary of Differences**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Type of Method     | Access Level                     | First Parameter | Use Case                                |\n",
    "|---------------------|----------------------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n",
    "| **Instance Method** | Instance-specific data           | `self`           | Access and modify instance attributes   |\n",
    "| **Class Method**    | Class-specific data              | `cls`            | Access and modify class variables       |\n",
    "| **Static Method**   | No access to instance or class   | None              | Utility functions that don't modify state|\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "Instances and methods are fundamental concepts in Object-Oriented Programming in Python. Instances represent specific objects created from classes, while methods define the behaviors of those objects. Understanding the differences between instance methods, class methods, and static methods is essential for effectively utilizing classes in Python. \n",
