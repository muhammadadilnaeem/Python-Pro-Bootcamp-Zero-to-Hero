    "# ***`Procedural Programming in Python`***\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Definition**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Procedural Programming** is a programming paradigm based on the concept of procedure calls. It emphasizes the sequence of actions to be performed, where a program is structured around procedures or functions that operate on data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Features**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Procedures/Functions**: The primary building blocks are functions that contain reusable code, which can be called multiple times throughout the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sequential Execution**: Code is executed in a linear fashion, from top to bottom, unless directed otherwise by control structures like loops and conditionals.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Global State**: Data is often shared across functions, typically using global variables, which can lead to unintended side effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Modularization**: While procedural programming can be modularized via functions, it doesn't encapsulate data and behavior like OOP.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example of Procedural Programming**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Basic Calculator**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# calculator.py\n",
    "\n",
    "def add(x, y):\n",
    "    return x + y\n",
    "\n",
    "def subtract(x, y):\n",
    "    return x - y\n",
    "\n",
    "def multiply(x, y):\n",
    "    return x * y\n",
    "\n",
    "def divide(x, y):\n",
    "    if y != 0:\n",
    "        return x / y\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return \"Error! Division by zero.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Main program\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    a = 10\n",
    "    b = 5\n",
    "\n",
    "    print(f\"Addition: {add(a, b)}\")         # Output: Addition: 15\n",
    "    print(f\"Subtraction: {subtract(a, b)}\") # Output: Subtraction: 5\n",
    "    print(f\"Multiplication: {multiply(a, b)}\")  # Output: Multiplication: 50\n",
    "    print(f\"Division: {divide(a, b)}\")      # Output: Division: 2.0\n",

    "## **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Definition**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. Objects are instances of classes, which can contain both data (attributes) and methods (functions).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Features**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Classes and Objects**: A class is a blueprint for creating objects. An object is an instance of a class, encapsulating both data and behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Encapsulation**: Data and methods are bundled together, restricting access to the internal state of an object to promote data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Inheritance**: New classes can inherit properties and methods from existing classes, promoting code reuse and establishing a hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Polymorphism**: Different classes can define methods that share the same name, allowing for flexibility in code and the ability to use a unified interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Abstraction**: Complex systems can be simplified by exposing only the necessary parts of an object, hiding the implementation details.\n",
    "\n",

    "**Example: Basic Calculator Using OOP**\n",

    "        if y != 0:\n",
    "            return x / y\n",

    "## **Advantages of Each Paradigm**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Procedural Programming**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simplicity**: Easier to understand for small scripts and straightforward tasks.\n",
    "- **Performance**: Generally faster for simpler tasks due to lower overhead.\n",
    "- **Straightforward**: Ideal for tasks that can be solved using a linear sequence of steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Object-Oriented Programming**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Modularity**: Easier to manage large codebases through encapsulation and separation of concerns.\n",
    "- **Maintainability**: Changes can be made with minimal impact on other parts of the program.\n",
    "- **Flexibility**: Polymorphism and inheritance provide more flexibility in code design.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "Both **Procedural Programming** and **Object-Oriented Programming** have their own strengths and weaknesses. The choice between them depends on the specific requirements of a project:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use Procedural Programming** for simpler tasks, scripts, or when performance is a critical factor.\n",
    "- **Use Object-Oriented Programming** for complex applications that require maintainability, scalability, and modular design.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding both paradigms allows Python developers to choose the right approach for their needs.\n",
