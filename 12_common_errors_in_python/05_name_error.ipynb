    "# ***`NameError in Python`***\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Definition**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **NameError** occurs when the Python interpreter encounters a name that it does not recognize. This usually means that a variable or function has been referenced before it has been defined or is not in the current scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Common Causes of NameError**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Using Undefined Variables**: Attempting to use a variable that has not been declared or initialized.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Typographical Errors**: Misspelling the name of a variable or function.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Scope Issues**: Referencing a variable that is out of scope (e.g., trying to access a local variable in a different function).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Function or Class Names**: Calling a function or class that has not been defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Common Scenarios Leading to NameError**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Using Undefined Variables**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   print(my_variable)  # Attempting to print a variable that has not been defined\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Output**:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   NameError: name 'my_variable' is not defined\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Typographical Errors**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_variable = 10\n",
    "   print(my_varible)  # Misspelling the variable name\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Output**:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   NameError: name 'my_varible' is not defined\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Scope Issues**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def my_function():\n",
    "       local_var = 5\n",
    "\n",
    "   print(local_var)  # Trying to access a local variable outside its scope\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Output**:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   NameError: name 'local_var' is not defined\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Function or Class Names**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def my_function():\n",
    "       return \"Hello\"\n",
    "\n",
    "   print(my_function())  # Correct usage\n",
    "   print(my_function2())  # Calling a function that does not exist\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Output**:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   NameError: name 'my_function2' is not defined\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Handling NameError**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can handle NameErrors using **try-except** blocks. This allows you to catch the error and respond appropriately without crashing the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example of Handling NameError**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    print(my_variable)  # Attempting to print an undefined variable\n",
    "except NameError:\n",
    "    print(\"Error: Variable is not defined.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output**:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Error: Variable is not defined.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Best Practices to Avoid NameError**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize Variables**: Always initialize your variables before using them.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_variable = 10\n",
    "   print(my_variable)  # This will work fine\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Check for Typos**: Carefully check variable and function names for typographical errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Use Consistent Naming**: Follow consistent naming conventions to reduce the likelihood of errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Scope Awareness**: Be aware of the scope of your variables. Local variables should not be accessed outside their defining function.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def my_function():\n",
    "       local_var = 5\n",
    "       return local_var\n",
    "\n",
    "   print(my_function())  # Correct usage\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Use IDE Features**: Utilize features provided by Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) or text editors, such as autocompletion and error highlighting, to catch issues early.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Comment Out Code**: When experimenting, comment out sections of code to isolate variables and functions, ensuring they are defined before use.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **NameError** in Python indicates that a variable, function, or class name is not recognized in the current scope. Understanding the common causes of this error and employing best practices can help you write more robust and error-free code. By initializing variables, checking for typos, and being mindful of scope, you can minimize the occurrence of NameErrors in your applications. \n",
